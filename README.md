# community-code
Shared code for data transforms, calling your model or just having fun with deep learning

A great starting point is:
image_classification/resize_and_bundle_images.py

You can turn two folders into a bundle.zip file ready to upload to the Peltarion Platform. 
Think "Hotdog" and "Nothotdog" :)
